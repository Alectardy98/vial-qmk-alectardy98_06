# Olivetti M24

A converter for the Olivetti M24 family of PCs, also including the AT&T 6300 and Xerox 6060 and 6068 word processor.

The [Theory of Operation](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/olivetti/m21_m24/Olivetti_M21_M24_Theory_of_Operation_Nov84.pdf) has information on the protocol signals and timimg, keyboard layouts and scan codes, and schematics for the keyboard and PC.

Keyboard Maintainer: [MMcM](https://github.com/MMcM)  
Hardware Supported: Olivetti ANK 2462, AT&T KBD 301, Xerox 37E, Xerox 38E, Adafruit Itsy-bitsy 5V  

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make converter/olivetti_m24:default

## Protocol

The procotol is somewhat reminescent of the IBM XT / AT protocol, in that there are separate clock and bidirectcional open collector datas signals. But the clock is generated by the PC, not the keyboard.

## Connections

These keyboards use a DE-9 M connector. There is a 5V regulator inside the keyboard, so a higher voltage (nominally 12V) is needed.

| DE-9 | Signal       | AVR |
|------|--------------|-----|
| 1    | DATA         | PD0 |
| 2    | CLOCK        | PD1 |
| 3    | GND          | GND |
| 4    | GND          | GND |
| 5    | +12VDC       |     |
