This drop in replacment PCB supports both a ATMEGA32U4-MU or a ATMEGA32U4-AU. Currently, it is often vary expensive or impoosable to have a pcb produced with a SMD ATMEGA32U4-AU chip. For this reason, either or can be used in case is one is out of stock. The firmware for this pcb will be the same regardless of what chip is used.
